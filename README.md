MFA

To create MFA from scratch, first, you'll need to set up user authentication (username and password). Then, you add a second factor, such as an OTP (One-Time Password) or Google Authenticator. Start by using libraries like speakeasy or otplib, which generate time-based OTPs. Upon user login, you send an OTP to them (via SMS, email, or an authenticator app). When the user enters the OTP, you verify it, and if correct, grant them access. You can use the qrcode library to generate QR codes so the user can easily link their account to an authenticator app. This system can be integrated into your Node.js server with the passport middleware, which will handle authentication. To enhance security, you can use JWT (JSON Web Tokens), which keep the session secure after login.
